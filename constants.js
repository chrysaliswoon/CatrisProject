// This is where the different configurations and rules for the game will be stored that won't change such as the size of the board.

// The Tetris board has a width of 10 (column), and height of 20 (row). In the event that this number changes (highly unlikely), the variable type will be changed to "Let".

// Tetris Board
const COL = 10; // width of board (left to right)
const ROW = 20; // height of board (top to bottom)

// Tetris Piece
const BLOCK_SIZE = 30; // size of the tetromino is 30 pixels
