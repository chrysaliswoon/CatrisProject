// This is where the different configurations and rules for the game will be stored that won't change such as the size of the board.

// The Tetris board has a width of 20 (row), and height of 10 (col). In the event that this number changes (highly unlikely), the variable type will be changed to "Let".

// Tetris Board
const COL = 10; // Width of the board is 10 columns
const ROW = 20; // Height of the board is 20 rows

// Tetris Piece
const BLOCK_SIZE = 30; //
