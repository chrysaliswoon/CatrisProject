# Developing a Tetris Game - Catris
## Description
This is a classic Tetris game with a fun cat spin on it. The game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

I chose to recreate this game as it was one of the games which I loved playing in my childhood and it's still addictive even in adulthood. The tile-matching game was created in 1984 by a Soviet engineer, Alexey Pajitnov, who loved puzzles. He developed it purely out of interest and didn't intend to make money out of it. He was inspired by a puzzle game called "pentominoes," in which different wooden shapes made of five equal squares are assembled in a box.

A lot of things which programmers create are usually based on things which currently exist all around us. I feel that this is what programming is to me. Creating things for the joy of it or because you want to use something which someone has not made by being inspired by your surroundings.

## Project Brief
**MVP - Minimum Viable Product** 
- Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery is strongly optional)
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Hosted on Github pages
- Commits to Github frequently
- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- Be displayed in the browser
- Have some kind of user interaction via mouseclick or keypress

**Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory)**
- Look into localstorage so you can save data to the user's browser

## Timeframe
1 month

## Technologies & Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub

## Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here: https://chrysaliswoon.github.io/CatrisProject/

## High Concept
Different bricks called Tetriminos which are randomly generated will fall down. Players will use the arrow keys to rotate, move, and drop the Tetriminos. Players will attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without any empty spaces, but if the Tetriminos surpass the Skyline the game is over!

I looked at various versions of Tetris to see how I can structure the visuals and structure of it, and you can take a look at some references I took in the Idea Board folder.

## Wireframing & Prototype
Before creating the code for the game, I created a wireframe and prototype using Figma. This allowed me to identify the various visual components of the game which will affect my HTML and CSS codes, and which parts I would need to make interactive, which affects the JS portion of my codes.

## Game Architecture
In order to understand the various components which I will need to create, I first played a standard Tetris game and observed how the Tetrominoes moved, the size of the Tetris Board, and what are the different types of variables involved.

Afterwards, I deconstructed it and drew out the various components:



## Approach to Development
Using the plan and pseudocodes, I broke down the project into stages:
- **Step 1:** Generate the Tetris Board [Timeline: 1 week]
- **Step 2:** Generate the Tetrominoes [Timeline: 2 weeks]
- **Step 3:** Create the Game Logic [Timeline: 2 weeks]
- **Step 4** (Stretch Goal): Create different levels and point system [Timeline: 2 weeks]
- **Step 5** (Stretch Goal): Retrieve scores [Timeline: 1 week]

When I was coding out the project, I made it a habit to comment on my codes frequently as I was still learning and I tend to forget certain concepts or code blocks which I have done or used before. This also meant that I also committed to GitHub frequently to log all of the changes to the project so I can retrieve an older version if necessary.

I also created notes and made a series of Medium articles which will give you insight into how I created the game:

## References
As JS is relatively new to me and there were a lot of concepts that I had to get used to. In order to start the ball rolling on my project, I referenced various sources in terms of how they created their Tetris game, and adapated and modified them to be mine as much as possible.
