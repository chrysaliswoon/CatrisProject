# Developing a Tetris Game - Catris
## Description
This is a classic Tetris game with a fun cat spin on it. The game was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

I chose to recreate this game as it was one of the games which I loved playing in my childhood and it's still addictive even in adulthood. The tile-matching game was created in 1984 by a Soviet engineer, Alexey Pajitnov, who loved puzzles. He developed it purely out of interest and didn't intend to make money out of it. He was inspired by a puzzle game called "pentominoes," in which different wooden shapes made of five equal squares are assembled in a box.

A lot of things which programmers create are usually based on things which currently exist all around us. I feel that this is what programming is to me. Creating things for the joy of it or because you want to use something which someone has not made by being inspired by your surroundings.

## Project Brief
**MVP - Minimum Viable Product** 
- Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (jQuery is strongly optional)
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Hosted on Github pages
- Commits to Github frequently
- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- Be displayed in the browser
- Have some kind of user interaction via mouseclick or keypress

**Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory)**
- Look into localstorage so you can save data to the user's browser

## Timeframe
1 month

## Technologies & Tools Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub

## Deployment
The game is deployed on GitHub pages, and you can play the game here: 

## High Concept
Different bricks called Tetriminos which are randomly generated will fall down. Players will use the arrow keys to rotate, move, and drop the Tetriminos. Players will attempt to clear as many lines as possible by completing horizontal rows of blocks without any empty spaces, but if the Tetriminos surpass the Skyline the game is over!

## Wireframing & Prototype
Before creating the code for the game, I created a wireframe and prototype using Figma. This allowed me to identify the various visual components of the game which will affect my HTML and CSS codes, and which parts I would need to make interactive, which affects the JS portion of my codes.

## References
As JS is relatively new to me and there were a lot of concepts that I had to get used to. In order to start the ball rolling on my project, I referenced various sources in terms of how they created their Tetris game, and adapated and modified them to be mine as much as possible.
