# Developing a Tetris Game
This is a classic Tetris game that was designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, and fundamental Javascript while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.

I chose to recreate this game as it was one of the games which I loved playing in my childhood and it's still addictive even in adulthood. The tile-matching game was created in 1984 by a Soviet engineer, Alexey Pajitnov, who loved puzzles. He developed it purely out of interest and didn't intend to make money out of it. He was inspired by a puzzle game called "pentominoes," in which different wooden shapes made of five equal squares are assembled in a box.

A lot of things which programmers create are usually based on things which currently exist all around us. I feel that this is what programming is to me. Creating things for the joy of it or because you want to use something which someone has not made by being inspired by your surroundings.

## Project Brief
- Render a game in the browser
- Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
